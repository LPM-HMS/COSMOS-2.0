Shell
=============

The Cosmos shell is an interactive IPython session with useful modules already imported.  It is a very powerful way to explore, manage, administrate and debug
your workflows.  It is highly recommended to interactively explore your workflows using an `IPython Notebook <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_

As a convenience, **wf** will be the most recent Workflow when you launch into the shell.

To launch the shell, just run:

.. code-block:: text

    $ cosmos shell /path/to/database.sqlite
    or
    $ cosmos shell sqlalchemy_database_url

    Out[1]:
    [<Stage[1] Hello>,
     <Stage[2] World>]

.. note::

    The list of the `workflows` list will become stale if another process runs a new Workflow.  Either restart the shell, or re-run
    the :term:`Sqlalchemy` query:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> workflows = list(session.query(Workflow).all())



Delete a Stage and all of its Descendants
-----------------------------------------
When you're developing workflows, things inevitably will go wrong.  More often than not, it is useful to fix a particular Stage and restart the Workflow
from there.  This avoids a lot of unnecessary re-computation of Stages that weren't affected by your code fix.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> wf.stages[4].delete(descendants=True)
    # or
    >>> for stage in wf.stages[4:]: stage.delete()
    # or
    >>> wf.stages[2].task.delete(descendants=True)

Note that setting delete_files=True can be slow if there are a lot of files to delete.  Usually it's better (especially in development) to set
delete_files=False and just have the next run overwrite the files.


Getting a Stage or Tasks Descendants
---------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    >>> wf.stages[4].descendants(include_self=True)
    >>> wf.stages[3].tasks[0].descendants(include_self=True)


Manually Altering Attributes
-------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    >>> wf.name='My_New_Workflow_Name'
    >>> wf.stages[0].name='My_New_Stage_Name'
    >>> for wf in workflows[-6:]: wf.status = WorkflowStatus.successful
    >>> session.commit() # write all changes to database so that they persist.  Always do this after you're done modifying objects.
